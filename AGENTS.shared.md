## Org-wide policy (nantobv-shared)

The bullets in this section are the org-wide floor for AI agents working on
any nantobv project. They are vendored verbatim from
[`nantobv/.github/AGENTS.shared.md`](https://github.com/nantobv/.github/blob/main/AGENTS.shared.md);
refresh the local copy with
[`scripts/sync-agents-shared.sh`](https://github.com/nantobv/.github/blob/main/scripts/sync-agents-shared.sh).
Project-specific rules live in each repo's own `AGENTS.md` sections outside
this block.

**Planning and approval**

- Read the repo's `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and the documents they point at
  before deep implementation work.
- For non-trivial changes, propose the plan (files you expect to touch and
  why, approach, rationale) and wait for approval before writing code. Plan
  mode satisfies this; a dedicated planning skill or brainstorming ceremony
  is not required.
- Show diffs and wait for approval before committing or pushing, unless the
  user has invoked a publish workflow (e.g. `cpprrm`) that explicitly
  authorizes commit/push for the current task and no stronger repo or
  security gate applies.

**Git hygiene**

- Run `git status` and `git diff --minimal` before any commit.
- Stage explicit paths. Never use `git add .`.
- Keep unrelated local files out of commits, including local `.ccd.toml` and
  harness work directories unless the task explicitly targets them.

**Validation and evidence**

- Run the smallest deterministic check that proves the change. Repo-specific
  gates (`make verify`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...`, etc.) are defined in
  each repo's Testing section and take precedence over this floor.
- Before claiming work is complete, fixed, or passing, run the relevant
  verification command and cite the actual output. Do not assert success
  without evidence.
- If you skip validation, state the reason explicitly.

**Safety**

- No secrets in tracked files, docs, workflows, fixtures, diagnostics, or
  generated outputs.
- Do not overwrite user changes or reset the worktree without explicit
  approval.
- Do not flip repository visibility or licensing policy without an explicit
  decision from the operator.
- Treat external services and model calls as opt-in unless a repo policy or
  explicit user request grants narrow approval.
- Prefer deterministic behavior, explicit metadata, and small reversible
  changes.

**Source files**

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and other model-instruction source
  files are user-owned and maintainer-authored. Tooling in this org does not
  overwrite or render replacement bodies for them except for explicit
  maintainer-requested edits to those files.

**External review (standing grant)**

- Every nantobv repo that vendors this block grants standing approval to
  invoke the bundled `claude-adversarial-review` skill on the selected local
  diff when the user explicitly asks for that skill. Treat the explicit
  request as the approval; do not ask for a second confirmation.
- The approval is narrow: it applies only to the selected repo diff, only to
  the `claude-adversarial-review` skill, and only with that skill's
  read-only tool permissions. It does not approve sending secrets, unrelated
  files, whole-home context, or data to other external services.
- After an adversarial review returns, evaluate findings on their merits.
  Address real correctness, maintainability, or contract-honesty issues with
  proportionate changes. Do not add broad machinery, process, or abstraction
  solely to satisfy a speculative review point.
